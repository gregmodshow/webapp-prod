We may at any time, and in Our sole discretion, change, modify, add to, supplement or delete the terms and conditions of any Promotional Program, including without limitation changing the name, fees and eligibility requirements to participate in such Promotional Program. We will endeavor to notify You of any material changes by email, but will not be liable for any failure to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Our general terms and conditions for promotional offers and programs (including offers and programs where you must redeem a promotional code as part of the offer or program) that are not otherwise described or made available on the</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Gift Cards</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Similar to Promotional Programs, at times and under circumstances in Our sole discretion, Modshow.tv may issue gift cards to certain Users (“Gift Cards”) that can be used solely to pay for Services and/or fees or expenses associated with the Services. Gift Cards are not replaceable if lost or stolen and have no expiration date, but in certain states, after a period of time, Modshow.tv may be required to remit the cash associated with unused Gift Card balances to such states pursuant to their abandoned property laws. Once We have remitted such cash to a state, if someone tries to redeem the Gift Card, it may no longer be redeemed and Modshow.tv may direct them to that state’s government instead. Gift Cards are not redeemable for cash except as required by applicable law.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>If You wish to redeem Your Gift Card and You can do so under applicable law, simply send your Gift Card along with a self-addressed envelope to Modshow.tv, Inc., Attention: Gift Cards, 1625 Clay Street, Suite 500, Oakland, CA, 94612. We’ll verify your address, confirm that Your Gift Card balance qualifies You for redemption, and send You a check for the exact amount due in the self-addressed and stamped envelope provided by You. If We can’t verify Your residency, or determine that the Gift Card is not required to be redeemed under applicable law, We’ll return your Gift Card in the envelope provided. We will be unable to redeem or return Your Gift Card without a self-addressed envelope and We are not responsible for mail that doesn’t arrive at the address provided. Furthermore, We cannot guarantee delivery in any way after submittal to the US Postal Service</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>A Gift Card cannot be combined with any other Gift Cards, gift certificates or other coupons for any given individual transaction on our Website. A Gift Card cannot be used as a credit or debit card. We reserve the right to limit quantities and usage amounts of Gift Cards purchased by any person or entity and to cancel a Gift Card if We believe that the Gift Card was obtained through fraudulent or unauthorized means. No credit card, credit line, overdraft protection, or deposit account is associated with Your Gift Card. You cannot “reload” (i.e., you cannot add value/balance to your Gift Card at this time). If a Gift Card holder’s purchase exceeds the amount of that Gift Card’s balance, the Gift Card holder must pay the difference by another means. We reserve the right to correct the balance of a Gift Card if We believe that a billing error has occurred, and we disclaim all liability for any such billing errors. Gift Cards and their use are subject to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy, and use of a Gift Card constitutes acceptance hereof. Finally, unused Gift Card balances are not transferable.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Currency</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>We are based in the United States and operate with US dollars as Our primary currency. We issue payments in US dollars. If You will be depositing Your gift money through our cash registry service into a non-US bank, Your bank may be assessed a currency exchange fee and/or a fee for a foreign deposit. You must consult Your bank for these details. If You are purchasing Modshow.tv Products with a non-US credit card, You may be subject to currency exchange fees levied by Your credit card company. Any concerns about exchange fees and rates should be directed to Your credit card company or bank.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Taxation Consequences</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>You acknowledge that We make no claims or promises regarding any and all tax obligations or consequences that may result from Your activities on the Website or use of the Services. You shall have full responsibility for applicable taxes for all gift funds paid to or received by You. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Us harmless from any liability for, or assessment of, any claims or penalties with respect to such taxes, including any liability for, or assessment of, withholding taxes imposed on Us by the relevant taxing authorities with respect to any funds paid to You.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Handling Fee</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>We do not have a fee to sign-up and create an account. For the use of the cash registry service, there is a handling fee assessed on each cash gift amount. The handling fee consists of Our administrative fee and the credit card processing fee charged by the payment processor and the merchant bank. The handling fee is borne by the gift-giver and will be added to the total amount charged to the gift-giver at check-out. The handling fee is not refundable in the event of cancellation of the cash gift or the cash registry.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Cash Registry</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p><u>Waiting Period</u></p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Once a cash gift is paid, the amount will be marked as pending during a 5-day waiting period before it is available to the User. The waiting period is for the protection of the User and Us against fraud, hackers and any other malicious conduct online.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p><u>Cash-Out</u></p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Each cash gift is available for cash-out after the waiting period. A cash-out payment will only be paid and transferred to the User who created the registry. Users can request cash-outs as often as You like, provided that each cash-out must be for the entire balance in the cash registry at the time of request.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>All cash-outs are processed within 24-48 business hours of request. We manually review each cash-out request for quality control before initiating the bank transfer. It usually takes 24-48 business hours for the payment processor to process the transfer and for the funds to be available in the User’s bank account. If You do not receive the funds, it is Your responsibility to contact Us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@Modshow.tv\">info@Modshow.tv</a>&nbsp;within 4 business days of the cash-out request to report that the funds have not arrived. Outside of this timeframe, it is not guaranteed that funds can be traced. We cannot commit to being able to recover the funds since We are restricted by the processes of Our payment processor and the banking system.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>We reserve the right to refuse to cash-out suspicious transactions that appear to have been made fraudulently. We also reserve the right to revise the cash-out time frame (beyond the initial 5-day waiting period) on a case-by-case basis for suspicious gifts or registries.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p><u>Canceling a Cash-Out Request</u></p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>You must email Us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@babylist.com\">info@Modshow.tv</a>&nbsp;or call 1-888-827-7856 immediately, but no later than 4 hours after submitting the request, if You need to cancel a cash-out request. If We have not yet processed the request, We can cancel the cash-out request and the money will be returned to Your cash registry. If We have already processed the request, unfortunately We cannot cancel the cash-out payment.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p><u>Canceling a Cash Gift</u></p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>You may cancel a cash gift and request a refund by emailing Us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@babylist.com\">info@Modshow.tv</a>&nbsp;or calling 1-888-827-7856 prior to the expiration of the waiting period. If We receive Your cancellation request within the waiting period, We will cancel the gift amount and refund the cash amount to You in the original form of payment, less the applicable handling fee for such transaction, which is non-refundable. You are also responsible for any fees associated with processing the return. After the expiration of the waiting period, unfortunately We cannot cancel the gift or refund the payment.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p><u>Canceling the Cash Registry</u></p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>The User that sets up the cash registry may cancel the registry at any time and either request a cash-out payment to such User or request a refund to be issued to the gift-givers of their respective gift amounts for any remaining balance in the cash registry. We will refund the cash amount to the gift-giver in the original form of payment, less the applicable handling fee for such transaction, which is non-refundable.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>Payments</p>\r\n\r\n                  <p>We use Stripe as Our payments processor.
